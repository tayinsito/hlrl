# HLRL - Human Learning Reinforcement Learning

HLRL is a flexible framework for learning and experimenting with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms like PPO, using Gymnasium environments such as `CartPole`, `LunarLander`, and beyond.

## Features
- Train RL agents in various environments
- Plug-and-play support for multiple Gymnasium environments
- Modular design for easy expansion
- Hyperparameter customization for fine-tuning performance

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. Anaconda

2. Clone repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tayinsito/hlrl.git 
        
2. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Training an Agent
# Run the training script with the desired environment:

    ex. python train.py --env CartPole-v1

## Testing a Trained Model
# Test the model on a selected environment:

    ex. python test_model.py --env CartPole-v1
